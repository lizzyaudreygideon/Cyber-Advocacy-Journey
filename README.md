# 🛡️My Cybersecurity Advocacy Journey

### "Translating the complex into the common sense."

Welcome! I am a **Cybersecurity Advocate** dedicated to bridging the gap between technical security concepts and everyday human behavior. I believe that security is a human right, and my goal is to empower non-technical audiences to navigate the digital world safely.

## 🎙️ Why I Advocate
Most people feel overwhelmed by cybersecurity. My mission is to sit on panels, lead workshops, and create content that replaces **fear** with **knowledge**. I don't just talk about "what" the threats are—I talk about the "why" and the "how-to-fix-it" for real people.

## 🚀 What I'm Building
This repository serves as my public learning lab and resource hub. Here, you will find:
* **Plain-English Explainer Guides:** Breaking down complex tech (Zero Trust, Encryption, Phishing).
* **Security Checklists:** Practical steps for individuals and small businesses.
* **Lab Notes:** Documentation of my technical growth (Networking, Home Labs, Tool Testing).

*"Security is only as strong as the person who understands why they are using it."*
